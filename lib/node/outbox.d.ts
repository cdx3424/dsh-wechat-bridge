/**
 * Rate-limit-aware outbound queue.
 *
 * Every WeChat-bound delivery goes through ONE serial per-process queue
 * (all peers share the channel's rate budget). Properties:
 * - priority ordering: approvals/errors (system) → answers (text) →
 *   tool cards → aggregated progress; FIFO within a priority;
 * - progress entries coalesce by `coalesceKey` (a newer digest replaces a
 *   still-queued older one — thinking/todo updates never pile up);
 * - a minimum inter-message interval spaces sends out;
 * - errcode -12 (rate limit) triggers escalating backoff;
 * - errcode -14 (session expired) pauses the queue entirely for a cooldown,
 *   mirroring the official session-guard behavior;
 * - everything is disposable: dispose drops queued entries and stops timers.
 *
 * The injectable send/now/sleep seams keep the pacing logic unit-testable.
